## IDE Version & Plugins

With respect tot the tools and frameworks we are using in this course, it is more useful to rely on the IntelliJ Ultimate Edition. As a student, you can register to the [Jetbrains Student pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) and get a license for free.

To support testing inside the application container, we rely on the Arquillian framework. Be sure that the "Arquilian JBoss support is installed"
